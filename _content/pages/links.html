<p>I used to maintain a large list of links on this page, but it had fallen into obsolescence.&#160; I now maintain a constantly growing list of links over at <a href="http://del.icio.us/chrisbenard">del.icio.us</a>.&#160; My friends and I use the service to share interesting links with each other.</p>  <p>Additionally, you can see all the blogs I follow by looking at my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/cbenard">Bloglines</a>, which I use as my RSS reader.</p>  <script src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/chrisbenard?count=20;title=My%2020%20Most%20Recent%20Del.icio.us%20Links;icon=rss;name;showadd" type="text/javascript"></script>
