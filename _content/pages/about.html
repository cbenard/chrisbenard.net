I am a 30 year old software developer specializing in .Net. I hold a <a href="http://business.latech.edu/graduate/mba.htm">Masters of Business Administration</a> from <a href="http://www.latech.edu">Louisiana Tech</a>. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in <a href="http://www.cs.lsus.edu/CollegeDegreeViewDetail.aspx?DegreeID=3">Computer Information Systems</a> from <a href="http://www.lsus.edu">Louisiana State University in Shreveport</a>.&#160; I attended <a href="http://www.caddomagnet.net/">Caddo Magnet High School</a>, where I graduated in 2001. I married my wonderful wife <a href="http://amandabenard.com">Amanda</a> in 2011 in Vegas. We moved to the Dallas area in 2009 and we've lived in Plano, Texas since 2010.</p></div>

<div class="info" style="clear:both">   <h3>What are Chris Benard's interests?</h3>    <p>I like computers and technology, a lot. I enjoy my work as a professional software developer.&#160; I feel fulfilled doing my work, and I feel like I make a difference.&#160; I've been programming since I was in first grade on my TRS-80.&#160; I can't imagine life without software development.</p>    <p>However, I have other interests.&#160; For instance, I'm often asked what I'd do if there weren't computers.&#160; My first response is that someone would just invent computers, but my second is that I would be a chemist.&#160; Chemistry interested me a lot during school, especially the mathematical parts, not necessarily the practical labs.</p>    <p>Beside my work, I enjoy hanging out with friends, skydiving, playing on Xbox Live, playing tennis, playing table tennis/ping pong, and anything else that seems fun.&#160; I like to listen to NPR rather than music radio, but I love to discover new music through Pandora.</p> </div>  <div class="info">   <h3><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px" height="138" alt="Boom! Headshot!" src="{{ pcurl('wp-content/uploads/2008/01/graduation-headshot2.jpg') }}" width="139" align="right" />What are Chris Benard's professional abilities?</h3>    <h4>Programming:</h4>    <p>I love software development.&#160; I enjoy taking business requirements and turning them into elegant, efficient computer programs.&#160; Web programming is my favorite, both because of keeping the information &quot;in the cloud&quot; and the instant deployment of updates.&#160; ASP.NET makes web programming extremely enjoyable and a breeze to code perfect solutions inside tight time frames.</p>    <p>I've also had a lot of experience developing Windows Forms programs.&#160; My experience, both in ASP.NET and WinForms, is in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.&#160; I develop solutions for internal and external reporting and analysis tools for our customers, in addition to fat clients that run at independent pharmacies.</p>
