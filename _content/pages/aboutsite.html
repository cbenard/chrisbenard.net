    <h3>Technology</h3>

    <h4>Hosting</h4>
    <p>
        I host the site on a <span title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</span> at
        <a rel="tooltip" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a2586db05512" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Referral link: If you spend $10, I get $10">Digital Ocean</a>. They are pretty awesome and give me
        complete control of the server. I pay only $5 per month and that includes an IPv4 address. DigitalOcean also provides
        2-factor authentication support, which is very important to me. I can't recommend them enough.
    </p>

    <h4>Content Management</h4>
    <p>
        This site is all static html generated by <a href="{{ piecrust.url }}">PieCrust</a> version {{ piecrust.version }}.
        Some redirection and mime-type modifications are made in a <code>.htaccess</code> file, but the site is static.
        PieCrust is a breeze to use and uses source files of HTML, templates (I'm using
        <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>), and a bit of <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Layout and Responsive Design</h4>
    <p>
        The HTML is based on <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. Dynamic functionality
        is courtesy of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, Bootstrap's integration with jQuery, and a tiny bit
        of my javascript code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The theme for my Bootstrap layout is <a href="http://bootswatch.com/flatly/">Flatly</a> from
        <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Code Highlighting</h4>
    <p>
        Code highlighting is provided by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Google
        Code Prettify</a>, a project by Google that does a great job a guessing (or you can be explicit) the language
        and highlighting appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm using the <a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styles/index.html">Desert</a>
        theme with Google Code Prettify.
    </p>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> handles all the comments extremely well, which is what allowed me
        to move this site to static HTML instead of a dynamic CMS. They made it a breeze to import my WordPress XML
        (after modifying it to add an atom xmlns namespace and remove some spaces at the top).
    </p>

    <h4>Previous Site</h4>
    <p>
        The previous version of this site ran on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. I am thankful that
        their database is easy to understand, which made it a breeze to import into PieCrust. I even helped extend
        the <a href="https://github.com/ludovicchabant/PieCrust/blob/master/src/PieCrust/Interop/Importers/WordpressImporter.php">WordPressImporter.php</a>
        class to improve WordPress imports. I maintain an even <a href="https://github.com/cbenard/PieCrust/blob/master/src/PieCrust/Interop/Importers/WordpressImporter.php">more functional version</a> in my fork.

    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="http://jtreminio.com">Juan Treminio</a> was instrumental in helping me to understand PieCrust, and I used
        his site's code as the basis for a lot of my work. I'm a .Net Developer by trade, and I appreciated him helping
        me through some of the PHP and PieCrust issues I had.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://sethgholson.com">Seth Gholson</a> gave me a lot of input during the development process, and
        criticized my work a lot, for which I am thankful. The site is better as a result.
