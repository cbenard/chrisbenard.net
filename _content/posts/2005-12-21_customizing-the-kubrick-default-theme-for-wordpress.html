Here's a catchup for some people.  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is the software that runs this blog.  Kubrick is the <a title="You can see the Kubrick default theme at work here" href="http://managedtasks.com/wpthemes/blog/index.php?wptheme=WordPress+Default">default theme</a> that comes with it.  You've probably seen it on a million blogs and on this one.  However, I wanted to customize mine with darker colors, like some of my <a href="http://old.chrisbenard.net/">previous</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040219205614/http://www.chrisbenard.net/">designs</a>.  I also wanted to have my picture up in the header part and again, darker colors.

I thought I was going to have to open photoshop and try to individually change the rasterized images since I didn't have any vector files (psd) to work with, but thankfully some guy (he didn't put his name on his blog) created a <a href="http://wateronlydries.com/2005/03/new-template-version/">PSD version of the Kubrick theme</a>, including rasterized and vector layers.  Naturally I went with the premade vector layers, overlaid a new image on top of it, and about 10 minutes later, I had the theme I had always dreamed of.  Thanks "some guy"!

In other news, I got <a href="http://courtneymalone.com">my roommate Courtney</a> to start a blog.  He wasn't using his domain for anything except email, so I set up wordpress and a nice theme for him too.  I even photoshopped his picture onto the green hillside :)  He couldn't help but use it, after I did all the work.
