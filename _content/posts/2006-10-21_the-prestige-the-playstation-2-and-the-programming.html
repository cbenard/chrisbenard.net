<strong>Update 1:</strong> Added Krystal Meyers picture and GH2 news.
<strong>Update 2:</strong> Fixed "lost"/"lot" typo, thanks to <a href="http://llembas.livejournal.com/">John McCain</a>.

Before I begin on the title's topics, I'd like to begin with another: Christian Music.  Normally, I dislike it because it's completely boring, and of course the content is verbal diarrhea.  However, recently, I prepaid for two years (MasterCard buy one year, get one free special) of <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/unlimited">Yahoo! Music Unlimited</a>.  YMU is really awesome, because it lets me listen to and download unlimited amounts of music.  By using <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=114916">FairUse4WM</a>, you can even completely strip the DRM and take your media wherever you want.

I don't even hardly ever use the download functionality, though.  I use YMU to keep me entertained at work while programming.  I rate the music when I listen to it, and YMU will add those ratings to my preferences.  I can then listen to "My Station", which will use those ratings to make further recommendations to me.

<span class="postimageright" style="width:160px"><img src="http://myspace-285.vo.llnwd.net/00845/58/24/845404285_m.jpg" alt="Krystal Meyers" />Krystal Meyers</span>With that said, that's not how I found Christian Music.  They also have advertising placed on some of the entry pages in the program, and I clicked on this <a href="http://www.myspace.com/krystalmeyers">Krystal Meyers</a> person's advertisement for her new album.  Now granted, I clicked on her because she's hot, but in my defense, the advertisement didn't say it was Christian music.  However, I think she is an <strong>awesome</strong> singer.  You should check out her music.

On Friday, <a href="http://robotbabytiger.blogspot.com">Chris</a>, who I got to sign up for YMU as well, even pointed out that I was jamming to a song about abstinence, <em>The Situation</em>.  I don't normally pay attention to lyrics, but I found myself singing "Maybe that's the beauty of grace!!!" to myself later after listening to the song of the same title.  Her music is just that good, that it makes me momentarily forget that I'm an atheist.  Chris said he's worried that I'm turning into a Christian.  After all, I did leave our Shreveport Atheists meeting 2 seconds earlier than he.

I didn't want any of that as part of the title of this post, and it would have ruined the P thing I had going on there, so sorry that you had to read that first.

I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a> with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jdoey">Joey</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/natbrat1">Natalie</a> last night.  That was probably the best movie that I've seen in a long time.  It rivaled Hero, and I'm not sure which would win.  It stars Hugh Jackman and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a>.  Christian Bale is my favorite actor ever.  It was directed by the same director as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>.  Those are two of my favorite movies ever.  It also had <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/">Scarlett Johansson</a> in a starring role, one of the hottest and best actresses ever.  (Also, she's released some kind of single that I heard on YMU that sounds like Frank Sinatra.  I don't like it.)

The point is, there were a lot of "ever"s in that previous paragraph, and they all point to The Prestige being an awesome movie.  Also, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000309/">David Bowie</a> plays Nikola Tesla, an unlikely but excellent performance.  And who doesn't like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/">Michael Caine</a>?  Go see this movie.

Also, Brandon and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/meefawgst__smp">white Bryan</a> were sitting really close to us and we talked to them right before and after the movie.  That was cool seeing them, since I hadn't seen them in forever.  Brandon asked what drugs I had been on, since he hadn't seen me in forever and I've lost a lot of weight since then.

Before the movie, I hung out at Joey's house for a few hours and we played ping pong for a while.  That was excellent; I hadn't played in forever, and I'm out of practice.  He also mentioned that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fuckyoutwiceagain">his friend/coworker</a> was trying to get rid of his PlayStation 2.  Apparently, the friend only wanted 40 bucks for a non-slim PS2 with controller and cables.  I had the cash on me, so I told Joey to tell the friend, who was also going to the movie, to bring the PS2.  I bought it, so now I have a PS2 sandwiched between my Xbox and Xbox 360.  Guitar Hero 2, here I come, especially since I'll be <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=70cJtVQUO9A">able to play</a> the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">Top Gear</a> theme song! (Get well soon, Hamster.)  <strong>Update:</strong> I just pre-ordered Guitar Hero 2 Game and Guitar and got a nifty little t-shirt to show for it.

I spent most of today catching up on the last week's TV watching.  I watched Battlestar Galactica, two CSIs, two The Offices, a ton of Colbert Report and Daily Shows, Mythbusters, CSI: New York, and a couple of episodes of <a href="http://www.wayofthemaster.com/">The Way of the Master</a> (more evidence for Chris).

I think I've worked out my weekend schedule.  On Fridays, I either do things with friends or accidentally fall asleep at 8pm.  On Saturdays, I catch up on TV and lie to myself and tell myself I'll do schoolwork.  On Sundays, I actually do schoolwork.  That seems to be the general way things have been going lately.

I was actually semi-productive today as well, though.  While watching the Colbert Reports and Daily Shows, I worked more on my Lab2 for CSC 460, finishing the business and data layers for the program.  I'll probably do the game manager part tomorrow.  

When going to find the links for this blog entry, Natalie's myspace is very hard to read, and it reminded me of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/soda10">Soda</a>'s myspace.  Her myspace makes my Firefox go very slowly and I can't even click on her picture because of the marquees.  I can't make people stop ruining the Internet and clogging the tubes, but I can write a bookmarklet to remove all that crap.  Stupid Wordpress won't let me put the actual link here, but you can grab the <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/downloads/fixmyspace.html">Fix MySpace Bookmarklet</a> from that page that I created.  Once it's in your bookmarks or links and you're on an ugly myspace page, just click it to remove all that ugly stuff.  It works like a charm and makes Natalie and Soda's pages legible.

Sorry for the extremely long post, not that anyone reads this.
