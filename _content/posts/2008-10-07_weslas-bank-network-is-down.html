<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> It's back up, 24 hours later, but the auto payment still isn't posted.</em></p>  <p><a href="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wesla.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="wesla" align="right" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wesla-thumb.png" width="232" height="200" /></a> I use <a href="http://www.wesla.org">Wesla Federal Credit Union</a> as my credit union. I don't actually use it as my primary checking anymore, although I used to. Today when I tried to login, I was greeted with what you see on the right:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;Could not retrieve your information... Please try again later.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>All I wanted to do was check to see if they had applied my auto loan payment I mailed Saturday. Well, I thought perhaps their online system was down or having trouble connecting to their database, and I couldn't remember my &quot;Touch Tone Teller&quot; PIN to check via phone, so I called and pressed the option to speak with a loan officer.</p>  <p>The conversation went something quite similar to this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Me: Are you having an issue with your online banking? When I log in it says &quot;Could not retrieve your information... Please try again later.&quot;      <br />      <br />Lady: Yes, our network is down right now.       <br />      <br />Me: Oh, ok. I just wanted to see if my auto loan payment that I mailed Saturday has been applied. Can you check for me?       <br />      <br />Lady: I can't check that. Our entire network is down so I can't access anything on the computer.       <br />      <br />Me: ...       <br />      <br />Me: ...       <br />      <br />Me: So if I wanted to come take my money out of the bank right now, could I?       <br />      <br />Lady: You can withdraw $200. That's the limit.       <br />      <br />Me: Um, ok. Thanks. *click*</p> </blockquote>  <p>That doesn't make me too confident in their ability to do business, but I just use them for a low interest auto loan right now, on which I'm making very successful, long strides in paying off early.</p>  <p>In other news, my boss is taking <a href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish" rel="friend met">Chris Leon</a> and me to lunch tomorrow at <a href="http://www.redlobster.com">Red Lobster</a>! Yay! I love their cheese biscuits!</p>
