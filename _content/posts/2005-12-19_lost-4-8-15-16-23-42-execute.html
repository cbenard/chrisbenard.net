If you know what that means, more than likely you're a fan of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">LOST</a> too.&nbsp; I was recently introduced to LOST after prodding from someone I met via <a title="The Facebook" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, which I will discuss later.  I had heard lots of people tell me about it, but I am naturally skeptical of new shows.  My roommate told me to watch it, and he acquired all of the old episodes, but I declined.  I didn't care about a show with a main plot device of a plane crash.  I've seen that, and it was a movie; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222/">Cast Away</a>.  Read on for the reasons why LOST is the best show ever.
<!--more-->
LOST is nothing like Cast Away; I literally fell asleep during that movie.  I was at a party at Jennifer's house when I heard some people talking about "Jack shooting somebody" or something, and I inquired what show they were talking about.  They told me, "LOST".  I asked, "I thought that show was about plane crash survivors."  They replied, "Yeah, it's all in the flashbacks."

That intrigued me; normally flashbacks just piss me off when trying to follow the plot line of a show, so I started watching the episodes my roommate had.  I was immediately hooked, and now I'm waiting <strong>four more weeks</strong> for more LOST.  Every single episode ends on a cliff hanger.  While you can certainly start watching it at any time since ABC recaps the info you need for the current episode, you really won't have an appreciation for what makes the show so great, <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/cast/78262.html">the cast</a>.

<strong>Jack</strong>
Jack is the hero at the beginning and he's a skilled doctor and surgeon.  He becomes a natural leader and is a compelling character when making crucial decisions for the entire group.

<strong>Kate</strong>
Kate is the yang to Jack's yin, or at least it appears that way up until some stress enters their "relationship".  She has a troubled past that was recently revealed and was actually a prisoner on the plane.  Don't worry, that's not really a spoiler; it was in the first few episodes.

<strong>Claire</strong>
Claire is a pregnant aussie woman.  Everyone has to care for her and views her as a burden at first.  Charlie becomes a surrogate husband for Claire.

<strong>Charlie</strong>
Charlie is a washed up rock and roll star for a band called <em>Driveshaft</em>.  They have a hit song, <em>You All Everybody</em>, that is extremely catchy.

<strong>Sayid</strong>
Sayid was a former Republican Guard in Iraq and used to torture people for a living.  Despite his violent past, he reserves judgement until he has all the facts.  He's extremely intense.

<strong>Locke</strong>
John Locke has to be the most interesting character for me.  We constantly learn more about him and I absolutely love his voice.  He's a tracker.  He's a box company collections manager.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's walking.  He's a carpenter.  He's an explosives expert.  He is everything, and he is one of the main reasons I'm hooked on the show.

I could go on listing other characters, and each have their own storylines, but those are my favorites.  Be sure to check out the show when you can, and buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNOG/qid=1134957470/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4052275-9747268?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846">the first season on dvd</a>, or rent it via <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>.

I think if you give LOST a chance, it won't disappoint you.  It's my new favorite show, and sure to be one of yours as well.  ABC doesn't do a good enough job of marketing; I guess I'm going to have to do it for them.  It's in reruns right now until January, but it's Wednesday nights at 9/8 central.
