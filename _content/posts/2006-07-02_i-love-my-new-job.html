If you read my blog or know me, you know I quit my job about a week ago.  I'm loving my new job as a C# developer, and I'm currently re-doing our main site with a co-worker/friend.  The resultant code will be used as the basis for future web projects.  It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.  Check the site in a few weeks when it will have quite a different look.

It's good to be able to make money doing what I actually like to do.  I've been programming since elementary school on a variety of systems and languages.  I program projects for myself and other in my spare time, so getting paid to do it isn't very much of a stretch.  As you might be able to tell from my <a href="/2005/12/17/working-on-the-weekend-sucks/">first blog post</a>, I have <strong>never</strong> voluntarily worked on a weekend at <strong>any</strong> company, with the exception of yesterday.  Chris and I really wanted to complete what we were doing on Friday, so we came in from about 12:30pm to 6:30pm on Saturday to finish refactoring some middle tier code.  Next up, I'll be working on some of the non-programmatic presentation layer so that we can begin work on the web forms part of the site.

It's very strange because the day seems to fly by extremely quickly, while at the same time, it feels like I haven't worked for my previous company in years.  It's amazing how easy it is for a new to absorb my attention so quickly and entirely when it is something that I love doing.

On an unrelated subject, I just completed my Fine Arts 140 class and got a 95%, an A.  I'm about to start my Finance 301 class next week, &lt;sarcasm&gt;which should be loads of fun&lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  At least my fall semester should be fun.  I'll be taking Computer Science 315, 345, 460, and 480.
