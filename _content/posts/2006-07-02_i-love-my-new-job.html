If you read my blog or know me, you know I quit my job at <a href="http://www.highlandclinic.com">Highland Clinic</a> about a week ago.  I also mentioned the CareerBuilder post they had up to replace me.  I linked to a <a href="/downloads/careerbuilder_hcjob.html">saved version</a> of the post in case they changed it.  They did change it.  The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/eokxn">new version</a> (<a href="/downloads/careerbuilder_hcjob2.html">locally saved copy</a>) is just a help desk position.  In other words, the position is for someone who just answers the phone, tries to solve basic problems, and escalates problems to other staff members via the ticketing system.

This is pretty strange, because this means one of two things.  One possible decision was that they no longer need someone who can do everything I was doing, which is highly unlikely considering the unsuccessful interviews already conducted.  This leaves only one logical conclusion in light of the two open positions on the <a href="http://www.highlandclinic.com/Careers">career page</a>; they are going to replace me with multiple people.  I must admit that I get a pretty big kick out of that.

In any case, I'm loving my new job as a programmer at <a href="http://www.newtechcomputersystems.com">New Tech Computer Systems</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="http://www.morrisdickson.com">Morris &amp; Dickson</a>.  I'm a C# programmer, and <a href="http://robotbabytiger.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> and I are currently redoing the Morris &amp; Dickson website.  The resultant code will be used as the basis for future web projects.  It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun.  Check the site in a few weeks when it will have quite a different look.

It's good to be able to make money doing what I actually like to do.  I've been programming since elementary school on a variety of systems and languages.  I program projects for myself and other in my spare time, so getting paid to do it isn't very much of a stretch.  As you might be able to tell from my <a href="/2005/12/17/working-on-the-weekend-sucks/">first blog post</a>, I have <strong>never</strong> voluntarily worked on a weekend at <strong>any</strong> company, with the exception of yesterday.  Chris and I really wanted to complete what we were doing on Friday, so we came in from about 12:30pm to 6:30pm on Saturday to finish refactoring some middle tier code.  Next up, I'll be working on some of the non-programmatic presentation layer so that we can begin work on the web forms part of the site.

It's very strange because the day seems to fly by extremely quickly, while at the same time, it feels like I haven't worked for Highland Clinic in years.  It's amazing how easy it is for a new to absorb my attention so quickly and entirely when it is something that I love doing.

On an unrelated subject, I just completed my Fine Arts 140 class and got a 95%, an A.  I'm about to start my Finance 301 class next week, &lt;sarcasm&gt;which should be loads of fun&lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  At least my fall semester should be fun.  I'll be taking Computer Science 315, 345, 460, and 480.
