<p>It's been 161 days since my last blog post, far too long.&#160; Lots of stuff has happened in my life since then.&#160; The anniversary of my birth has passed once again, and I'm 25 now.&#160; I've loved.&#160; I've lost.&#160; I've been things in between.&#160; I've been sick.&#160; I've had a tooth pulled out.&#160; My car was flooded in a flash flood.</p>  <p>All of these things were bloggable events, and perhaps I will blog about them in the future.&#160; I plan to write a few blog posts, at least, about some Web 2.0 services that I've been using.&#160; I needed this post to at least break the ice for myself to be able to start blogging again.&#160; 161 days is a scary amount of time to go without writing anything.</p>  <p><a title="My Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/cbenard" target="_blank" rel="me">Twitter</a> has been stealing a lot of my writing outlet mindshare.&#160; I blame it, even though I just recently started using it.&#160; It's just too damn easy to blurt out a quick thought on Twitter than it is to make a well reasoned post here.&#160; I hope to be better, at least in the near future.</p>
