<img style="float:right;margin:0 0 5px 5px" src="/images/stevecroc.jpg" alt="Steve Irwin, Crocodile Hunter, with a Crocodile" />According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/04/australia.irwin/index.html?section=cnn_latest">this CNN article</a>, Steve Irwin, better known as the "Crocodile Hunter", is dead at age 44.



<blockquote>Australian media reports say Irwin was diving in waters off Port Douglas, north of Cairns, when the incident happened on Monday morning.

Irwin was killed by a stingray barb that went through his chest, according to Cairns police sources. Irwin was filming an underwater documentary at the time.</blockquote>

That sucks that he won't ever be on TV again.  I enjoyed doing his accent.  Now, I'll probably just be depressed when I do it.  Stupid stringrays.
