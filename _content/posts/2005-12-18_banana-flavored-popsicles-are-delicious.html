If you know me well, you might know that I love banana flavored anything, and I especially love <a href="http://www.budgetsaver.com/banana.html">Budget $aver Banana Popsicles</a>.  This company is great; they make one product, popsicles.  They have a nice <a href="http://www.budgetsaver.com/history.html">history writeup</a> of their company on their webpage and little sob story on the back of every package:

<blockquote>
You are very important to our small company.  We are trying to make the best tasting banana water ice pops that we possibly can.  We are also trying to keep our price as low as possible.

If you have an idea, or don't feel you have received your money's worth, please call TOLL FREE weekdays 9-4 eastern time at 1-800-322-3642 or visit our website at <a href="http://www.budgetsaver.com">www.budgetsaver.com</a> and let us know.

Thank you for trying Budget $averÂ®.

I've never felt like a company was talking to me before when I've looked at the back of their package, so I thought I'd pass it on.  Their banana flavored popsicles are delicious, and extremely inexpensive.  I paid $1.50 plus tax for 18 packs of the "water ice pops", each containing two "pops".  4 cents per "pop" is a steal, and you can get them at Wal-Mart and Brookshire's, at least around here.
