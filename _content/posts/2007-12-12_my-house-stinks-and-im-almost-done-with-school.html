<p>It smells like rotting flesh in my house.&#160; It's absolutely horrible.&#160; I've been through this before.&#160; Some animal has taken it upon itself to crawl up inside my attic and die.&#160; Then my house smells like death for a week.&#160; You'd think I'd have to do something about it, but I've ignored it in the past, and like all problems, that makes it go away.&#160; I hope that'll work that time.&#160; Does anyone have any input on that particular problem?&#160; (Don't come over to my house this week for sure.)</p>  <p>Not that that's related in any way to my school, but I've taken half of my finals, and since I didn't care about this semester, I've gotten a B in Math 201 (Discrete) and a B in English 201 (Introduction to Fiction).&#160; I only have Management 301 (Principles of Management) and Communications 135 (Speech) left.&#160; I'm pretty sure I'll end up with As in those classes.&#160; December 19th at 7pm at the CenturyTel Center, I graduate.&#160; Yay!&#160; Everyone is invited!</p>  <p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on my mood, I start on the MBA program in the Spring.&#160; I took the GMAT and I only had to make a 450 on it since I have a high GPA, and I passed it with ease.&#160; All in all, I liked this semester; I made some new friends and didn't really try all that hard.&#160; I have senioritis and I don't care what I get; I'm just ready for this to all be over.&#160; I've spent far too long in school.&#160; Perhaps they'll confer a PhD on me instead.</p>  <p><a href="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mcpdrgb-504-505.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="79" alt="MCPD(rgb)_504_505" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mcpdrgb-504-505-thumb.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a> In other news, I'm now certified as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/">Microsoft Certified Professional Developer</a> in both <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/windev/">Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/webdev/">Web</a>.&#160; I actually made a perfect score on the Windows one and a 976 on the Web one.&#160; I've scheduled <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/">MCPD: Enterprise</a> for Monday, December 17th, so I hope I pass that too.&#160; My work is reimbursing me for all the tests, which is good, since they're $125 each.</p>  <p>Speaking of work, I ate a lot of food today.&#160; We had a pot luck lunch for our building and everyone brought stuff, except for me.&#160; I didn't even think I'd be able to make it.&#160; I had a two hour final starting at 10:30 and the lunch started at 11:45.&#160; I actually rushed through my Math 201 final in order to make it back in time, and I got there only like 2 minutes late.&#160; I'm a free food whore.&#160; I even stayed a little late tonight and ate the night class (they teach support people downstairs about XP)'s food.&#160; When I get to eat for free, I feel like I'm sticking it to the man.&#160; Yeah, I know that makes me weird.</p>
