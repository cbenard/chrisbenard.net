<p>My stupid <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=113">Motorola Q</a> <a href="http://discuss.pocketnow.com/showthread.php?t=21035">died</a>, so I had to send it off to Motorola, since it's still under warranty from them and I didn't buy Sprint's stupid warranty.&#160; It wasn't really that big of a deal, and I wasn't even that upset to pay them shipping.&#160; They said in the instructions to send <strong>no</strong> accessories, including batteries, headsets, etc, so I made sure not to do so.&#160; Apparently, however, the battery <strong>cover</strong> is an accessory, and they deemed it unnecessary to send it back to me.&#160; I now hate Motorola.</p>  <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="240" alt="Samsung A900M" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/a900mo.jpg" width="84" align="right" border="0" /> In the absence of the Motorola Q smart device, I switched back to using a non-smart <a href="http://www2.sprint.com/mr/news_dtl.do?id=13382">Samsung A900M</a>.&#160; I've grown to appreciate the feel of a tiny little phone that has all the functionality I need.&#160; I think I'm going to sell the Moto Q on eBay when I get a battery cover back from them.&#160; I've yet to call them, because I hate dealing with Moto Customer Service, and I'm sure I'm going to end up having to buy a new one or something.&#160; The lesson of that story is to buy Sprint's ripoff insurance when you get an expensive phone.</p>  <p>That would be the end of the story, except tonight, I dropped my phone on the ground outside when I went to my parents house, spent a while there, left, and then realized that I didn't have my phone.&#160; Driving up to my parents driveway again, I saw my phone blinking there in the driveway (SMS and Voicemail alert).&#160; It had been raining the whole night, so my phone had gotten a good drenching, and the thing just kept on working.&#160; I just can't believe how many times I've dropped that little phone and gotten it wet, and it just stands up to my unwarranted abuse.&#160; Good job, Samsung.&#160; Motorola, tsk tsk.</p>
