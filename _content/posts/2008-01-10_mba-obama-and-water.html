<h3>MBA</h3>  <p>Today, I finally was able to register for <a href="http://www.lsus.edu">LSUS</a>' <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/ba/mba/">Masters of Business Administration</a> program.&#160; I had to go to a stupid orientation that wasted 30 minutes of my life and then had to go across campus to a computer lab to waste another 30 minutes of my life where they showed people how to register.&#160; I just needed them to unlock my <a href="http://compass.lsus.edu">Compass</a> so I could register.&#160; I'm not a retard so I knew which classes I wanted.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennyroe">Jenny</a> is also starting the MBA program, though she is doing pre-requisites, so she was able to already register for her classes, and they made her go to it too.&#160; We then went to get our new <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/uc/pilotcard.asp">Pilot Card</a>s made which took forever, and then to the bookstore to find out how ridiculously expensive books are.</p>  <p>All in all, I paid a little over $1500 for school and $400 for books.&#160; I hate school.</p>  <h3>Obama</h3>  <p>Conservatives will believe almost anything that another one of their kind makes up about a non-conservative candidate, so it shouldn't surprise me that people would believe <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/19/fox-obama-madrassa/">absolutely fabricated lies</a> about <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Obama</a>'s background as a &quot;radical islamist&quot; and things like that.</p>  <p>Today at work, someone forwarded around that lie, so I did reply to all, and I set the record straight:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>That story about Obama is not true, even though it claims &#8220;We checked this out on &quot;snopescom&quot;.&#8221; </p>    <p>See the snopes article: </p>    <p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp</a></p>    <p>Chris Benard</p> </blockquote>  <p>Not surprising, I suppose.&#160; I just get irritated by people spreading lies, especially when the lie even says it was verified by <a href="http://www.snopes.com">Snopes</a>, which it obviously wasn't.&#160; People will actually believe these things without looking them up like I do.</p>  <h3>Shreveport Water</h3>  <p>Well, you know what they say about <a href="http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/">Shreveport</a>: it's a nice place to visit, but don't drink the water.&#160; We're the new Mexico.&#160; They don't really say that, but <em>they</em> might now.&#160; Today, we had a <a href="http://www.ktbs.com/news/Break-at-water-plant-isolated;-water-pressure-returning-to-normal-7775/">serious water situation</a>.&#160; It's still not back to normal, and a boil advisory is still in effect.&#160; I won't be drinking city water for a long time.&#160; Luckily, we have bottled water at work, and I have bottled water at home.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.fatburger.com/">Fatburger</a> was closed when I went by today, and <a href="http://www.moes.com">Moe's</a> was only serving bottled drinks.&#160; Circle K wouldn't sell <a href="http://www.iceeusa.com/">ICEE</a>s or fountain drinks.&#160; All the children were sent home from school and won't be returning tomorrow.&#160; Lots of people are being affected by this, and it shows how serious of a problem it is to have a single water treatment facility.</p>
