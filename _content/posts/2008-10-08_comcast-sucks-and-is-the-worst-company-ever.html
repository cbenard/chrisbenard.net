I hated them before, and I hate them more now. Before anyone tells me to, I'm going to send this to <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares">Comcast Frank (comcastcares)</a> when I'm finished.</p>  <p>All I wanted to do was get the hours of the local office, but you can't get that on their web site, because they have no &quot;Store Locator&quot; type function that every other business has. I thought I'd do the live chat option to find the information, but knowing <a href="http://consumerist.com/5052318/comcast-merges-with-thrifty-liquor">the problems</a> that my coworker <a href="http://pirootofpi.com" rel="friend met">Dave Anderson</a> had trying to get the phone number for the local office before, I was very specific.</p>  <p>I ended up spending 32 minutes, <strong><em>more than half and hour</em></strong>, and ended up with nothing to show for it. They first gave me the address of a grocery store that hasn't dealt with Comcast in over 5 years and then gave me the address of a shopping center in Shreve City that has no Comcast there. I'm not sure what business they intended me to contact.</p>  <p>Then, amazingly, they gave me the same information for Thrifty Liquor that they gave Dave before, except this time, I noticed they're not giving the <strong><em>name</em></strong> of the business where they're referring you anymore. Way to go on the changes Frank!</p>  <p>She then tried to get me to leave the chat by telling me to call the &quot;local&quot; number because she's in Canada. She gave me the <strong><em>wrong number</em></strong> to the local office, giving me an &quot;out of service&quot; message! Ridiculous! I knew far more about the cable locations and numbers than she did, which isn't saying much.</p>  <p>The reason I'm returning 3 cable boxes in the first place and canceling all of the digital cable is because of the absolutely horrible &quot;SARA&quot; software they put on the Comcast DVRs. The old &quot;Passport&quot; software wasn't exactly TiVo, but it was completely usable, and actually intuitive. The new software &quot;looks like an old Nintendo game&quot; (actual quote), according to my girlfriend, and I completely agree.</p>  <p>My father hates SARA. My mother hates SARA. All of my coworkers hate SARA. Two of my coworkers are canceling cable for their household because of SARA. Everyone I know hates SARA, but according to Comcast Frank, <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares/statuses/932136453">it's here to stay</a>, because of some contractual agreement with TV Guide.</p>  <p>If you'd like to read the absolutely excruciating transcript with their support agent that took me over 32 minutes to make it through, please read on. She did end it with an amusing mistake: &quot;I do apologize for the Chris.&quot;</p> <!--more-->  <blockquote>   <pre>Online Comcast Chat Transcript:</pre>

  <pre>they said they haven't dealt with you guys in over 5 years</pre>

  <br /><b>Chris_</b>(Wed Oct 08 2008 10:19:42 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time))&gt; 

  <pre>and they confirmed that you guys are absolutely ridiculous</pre>

  <br /><b>Chris_</b>(Wed Oct 08 2008 10:19:50 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time))&gt; 

  <pre>and that they keep calling trying to get you guys to stop sending people to them</pre>

  <br /><b>Chris_</b>(Wed Oct 08 2008 10:22:19 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time))&gt;
