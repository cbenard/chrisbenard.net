<div class="new"><strong>Update:</strong> I have created a <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2010/01/27/followup-on-my-predictions-for-apples-tablet-event/">new blog post</a> (Jan 27th, 2010) for my response to what happened and the outcome of each of my predictions.</div>  <p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you are no doubt aware that Apple plans to reveal their “<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/25/our-live-coverage-of-the-apple-tablet-latest-creation-event-starts-wednesday/">latest creation</a>” tomorrow, January 27th, 2009. It is most likely their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/26/the-apple-tablet-a-complete-history-supposedly/">long awaited</a> iTablet/iSlate/iWhatever. I’ll be following Engadget’s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/live-from-the-apple-tablet-latest-creation-event/">live blog of the event</a> tomorrow.</p>  <p>It is also my birthday tomorrow, but I don’t care as much about that. I just want to know what Apple’s been doing all this time and what they’re going to announce. I’m pretty sure that makes me nerdy, among <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/about">other</a> <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/resume">qualifications</a>.</p>  <p>These are my tablet related predictions, which I will update with the results:<img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Concept mockup, courtesy of Engadget" border="0" alt="Concept mockup, courtesy of Engadget" align="right" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/image.png" width="302" height="154" /> </p>  <ol>   <li>Apple will announce a tablet device of some kind. </li>    <li>It’s name will begin with a lower case I. I have to get at least one correct, right? I’ll guess iTablet. I don’t think they’ll do iSlate. </li>    <li>The device will not have an e-ink screen. </li>    <li>The device will not have an AMOLED screen. </li>    <li>It will be a conventional LCD screen with LED backlighting. </li>    <li>It will not run full OS X. Only a subset will be allowed, such as Safari, etc. Only apps from an app store will be allowed. </li>    <li>There will be a tablet app store. </li>    <li>There will be backwards compatibility for iPhone apps running in some kind of emulation mode. </li>    <li>There will be a innovative text input method. I can’t speculate as to what it will be, but knowing Apple, it will be good. </li>    <li>Its battery life will be expressed in hours, not days or weeks, unlike the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrisbenarddo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA">Kindle</a> or <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp">Nook</a>. </li>    <li>Verizon will be announced as a 3G data partner for the tablet device. </li>    <li>The tablet will sell like hotcakes at first because Apple made it, but I think this will be a fad device and perhaps regarded as Apple’s second flop (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_%28platform%29">Newton</a>). I am putting this down “on paper” because I think it will be funny if I’m completely wrong and I can read my own words in a year or so. </li> </ol>  <p>My other predictions for the event are as follows, which I will also update with results:</p>  <ol>   <li>No new iPhone will be announced. </li>    <li>No AT&amp;T exclusivity related announcements will be made (this will be saved until <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/12/21/wwdc_2010_iphone_announcement_rumored_for_june_28_july_2.html">WWDC in June</a>). </li>    <li>Incremental changes will be made for the iPhone OS, perhaps allowing some sort of rudimentary multitasking, perhaps in a 3.5 or 4.0 revision of the OS. </li> </ol>  <p>Additionally, I am aware that I haven’t blogged in 5 months. I’ll be following up on this post with some sort of recap explaining what I’ve been doing.</p>
