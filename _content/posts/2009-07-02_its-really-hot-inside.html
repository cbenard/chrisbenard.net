Yesterday, it got up to 93 degrees (Fahrenheit) in our office and I actually started sweating. <a href="http://hoekstraisameme.com/">Now I know</a> how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc">Joan of Arc</a> felt when she was being burned alive at the stake. The air conditioner went out Tuesday (6/30/2009) and they just got the part(s) in today (7/2/2009) to fix it. What follows is what I like to believe is at least a good a version as <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/07/iraq_takes_a_step_toward_sover.html">Boston Globe’s Big Picture</a> of our harrowing experience.
