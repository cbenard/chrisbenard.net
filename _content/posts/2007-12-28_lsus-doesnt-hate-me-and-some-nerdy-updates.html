<p><a title="Letter from LSUS - MBA Admission" href="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mba-admission-redacted.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px" height="240" alt="MBA Admission - Redacted" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mba-admission-redacted-thumb.jpg" width="159" align="right" /></a>Apparently <a href="http://www.lsus.edu">LSUS</a> doesn't hate me.&#160; They've admitted me into their <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/ba/mba/">Masters of Business Administration</a> degree program, not that <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/ba/mba/admissions.asp">the requirements</a> are all that stringent.</p>  <p>I've just been waiting forever to get <em>something</em> in the mail from them, so this is finally some good news.&#160; Unfortunately, I have to go listen to them drone on about the school that I've already been attending forever before they'll unlock my courses so I can register on <a href="http://compass.lsus.edu">Compass</a> myself.&#160; That school is so ignorant sometimes.</p>  <p><a title="New Computer Parts" href="https://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/Wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=6546391&amp;WishListTitle=New+Computer"><img style="margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px" height="180" alt="Me holding Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 2.4GHz" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/core2quad2.jpg" width="240" align="left" /></a> In other news, I built (or rather <a href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish">Chris</a> built) a new computer.&#160; It's a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16819115017">Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.4GHz</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820141337">pqi 4GB(2 x 2GB) DDR2 (PC2 6400)</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131180">ASUS P5K Motherboard</a>, and a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814145146">CHAINTECH GSE86GT-A1 GeForce 8600GT 256MB 128-bit GDDR3 PCI Express x16</a> video card.&#160; Yes, I know the video card is crap, but I don't play PC games at all.&#160; I play games exclusively on my <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360elite/">Xbox 360 Elite</a>.&#160; I just needed a DirectX 10 capable card to offload all of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/abouttn/flash/tips/tips_092805_2.mspx">Aero Glass</a> to the video card, rather than the processor.&#160; All four parts cost a total of $630 on 12/19/2007.</p>  <p>This new computer is insanely fast and runs much cooler and quieter than my old PC (Athlon 64 3000+ with <a href="http://www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=1879">SilentBoost K8</a> fan).&#160; Speaking of Aero Glass, I'm a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/default.mspx">Vista</a> convert.&#160; It works much nicer on this hardware than on the previous hardware I tried, and I really like its interface and layout.&#160; If you use Vista, definitely get <a href="http://insentient.net/">Switcher</a>.&#160; It's life changing.</p>  <p>On Vista, <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview">Windows Live Writer</a>, which I've been using to compose my blog posts over the past couple of months (and it's totally awesome), works a lot better on Vista.&#160; I'm guessing that it's written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation"><acronym title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</acronym></a> or something, but I'm not sure.&#160; On my XP, it flickered a lot, a common problem if you look in the forums.&#160; I've had none of those issues on Vista.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, my keyboard software (iTouch) doesn't work with my <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/478/3366&amp;cl=us,en">Logitech keyboard</a>.&#160; Someone wrote replacement software for Vista called <a href="http://www.nabocorp.com/ntouch/">nTouch</a>, but it only works if the media application (I use <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/ymu/">Yahoo! Music Unlimited</a> so I have to use <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/jukebox/">Yahoo! Music Jukebox</a>) is focused.&#160; That removes the entire utility of the media keys!&#160; So, I'm faced with one of two choices: switch to the Jesus of keyboards, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a> (I swear by it at work [software developer]), or live with degraded media key support.&#160; The reason I'm still using this Logitech Cordless Elite Duo is because of the nice keyboard media keys, which the Microsoft Natural 4000 doesn't have.</p>  <p>The other issue is my scanner.&#160; I use a <a href="http://support.visioneer.com/products/home/EOL/8700/">Visioneer OneTouch 8700</a>.&#160; There is no Vista support, and the scanner has been <acronym title="End of Life (No longer supported)">EOL</acronym>ed, and there will be no Vista support.&#160; Another choice: buy another scanner, or do something completely nerdy.&#160; I chose the nerdy path of course, and installed <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMWare Workstation</a> 6.02.&#160; It has the ability to virtualize USB devices, not just the installed driver versions of them.&#160; In other words, the guest OS can see the raw USB device and install its driver for it.&#160; The host doesn't have to have any knowledge of what's hooked up to the PC.&#160; So my guest, XP, can see the scanner and use its drivers and the host, Vista, doesn't know anything about the scanner.&#160; I installed <a href="http://www.nuance.com/paperport/">PaperPort</a> inside my tiny VM, and it all runs extremely quickly on my new hardware.&#160; So now, when I want to scan, instead of firing up just PaperPort, I fire up a suspended virtual machine with PaperPort already running.</p>  <p>Whatever.&#160; Bottom line: I love my new computer, Vista, Switcher, and Windows Live Writer a lot, and I'm glad the MBA program at LSUS finally realized that I applied.</p>
