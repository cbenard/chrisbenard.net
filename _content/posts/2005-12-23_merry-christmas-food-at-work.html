I'm lucky to work with a bunch of women who bring food to work all the time.  We're having one of our office parties.  I always cop out by buying a 12-pack or two of <a href="http://www.dietcoke.com/notLoggedIn.jsp">Diet Coke</a>s.  I scored big time today.  I got a chocolate bar, coffee mug with <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/kisses/">Hershey's Kisses</a> and <a href="http://www.conagrafoods.com/brands/swiss_miss/index.jsp">Swiss Miss</a>, homemade banana bread, and a lottery ticket from our CFO, <a href="http://redchina.textamerica.com/?r=612297">Debbie</a>.  In that last link, my boss Jay makes an appearance too.

Also, a huge thanks to <a title="Ashley, the middle desk" href="http://redchina.textamerica.com/?r=1760274">Ashley</a> (middle desk) for making some of her circular noodles and sauce stuff for me.  I love that stuff.  What a great present!

Merry Christmas Food!</div>

It makes having to work today <strong>almost</strong> worth it.
