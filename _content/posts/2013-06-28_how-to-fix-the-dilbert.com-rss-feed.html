###Dilbert.com Hates Its Users
<div class="clearfix">
	<div class="postimage well pull-right leftbottompad">
		<a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="{{ page.slug }}" href="{{ assets['badfeed-crushed'] }}">
			<img src="{{ assets['badfeed-small-crushed'] }}" alt="Bad RSS Feed with No Pictures" />
		</a>
	</div>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert.com</a> recently messed up their web comic
		<a href="http://feed.dilbert.com/dilbert/daily_strip">RSS feed</a> that I use to read the
		comic every day. They did this so that you have to click through to the website
		to read each and every comic. All you can see is what's to the right here.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://penny-arcade.com">Penny-Arcade</a> did this quite a while back too, and
		I've been using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=IjjUcuSa3RGmgXqp1L3fcQ&amp;_render=rss">someone's
		Yahoo Pipe</a> that fixes this same problem. It just pulls the comic strip images from the page
		and displays it instead. I never dug into how it worked or <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a>
		at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yahoo Pipes is pretty awesome. It lets you just drag and drop things and connect them
		to arrange a workflow. <a href="{{ pcurl('about/') }}">I'm a developer</a>, but I don't think
		you have to be to use Pipes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the Penny-Arcade one as an example, I rigged up two versions of the Dilbert.com feed.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Large Image Version</h4>
			This version looks great, especially on high DPI devices, as I've set the style to
			<code>width: auto; max-width: 100%</code>. If your reader supports it, like
			<a href="http://theoldreader.com/">TheOldReader</a> (which I highly recommend and here's
			<a href="http://theoldreader.com/profile/cbenard">my profile</a>), then it will display beautiful,
			large-resolution images and scale appropriately.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=1fdc1d7a66bb004a2d9ebfedfb3808e2">Pipe Link</a> (so you can see how it works and edit it)</li>
				<li><strong><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=1fdc1d7a66bb004a2d9ebfedfb3808e2&amp;_render=rss">RSS Link</a></strong> (what you need to add the subscription in your reader)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Regular Image Version</h4>
			This version also scales using
			<code>width: auto; max-width: 100%</code>, but it uses the smaller image (but larger than the original feed's "print" image size).
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=feff1572a71d8e1d04465296edf5a537">Pipe Link</a> (so you can see how it works and edit it)</li>
				<li><strong><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=feff1572a71d8e1d04465296edf5a537&amp;_render=rss">RSS Link</a></strong> (what you need to add the subscription in your reader)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Clone of Original Feed</h4>
			This version should be a clone of the original feed. It includes no link, no CSS styling, and it uses the original "print" image size. It just contains <code>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dilbert.com/path/to/image.strip.print.gif&quot;/&gt;</code> as the RSS item description.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=1f33f50b7e2a1162758e9061a16cca83">Pipe Link</a> (so you can see how it works and edit it)</li>
				<li><strong><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=1f33f50b7e2a1162758e9061a16cca83&amp;_render=rss">RSS Link</a></strong> (what you need to add the subscription in your reader)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

###What It Looks Like Now With These Pipes

<div class="postimage well pull-left rightbottompad">
	<a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="{{ page.slug }}" href="{{ assets['theoldreader-screenshot-crushed'] }}">
		<img src="{{ assets['theoldreader-screenshot-small-crushed'] }}" alt="Much Better RSS Feed with Pictures" />
	</a>
</div>

<p>
	By the way: I'm using a great <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/87977/the-old-reader-blue-accent">Blue User Style</a> in Chrome. I like the blue a lot better than TheOldReader's default sea green.
</p>
<p>
	Now you get Dilbert back the way it used to be and don't have to link out to the site to read it. I still left each image as a link to the post's page on <a href="http://dilbert.com">Dilbert.com</a>.
