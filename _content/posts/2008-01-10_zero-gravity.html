<p>After <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2008/01/05/wedding-and-ice-skating/">ice skating last week</a>, <a href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish">Chris</a>, <a href="http://llembas.livejournal.com">Jen</a>, and I were going to go to <a href="http://www.dallascityhall.com/">Dallas</a> to <a href="http://www.dallasgalleria.com">The Galleria</a> to go ice skating there on a better rink.&nbsp; Jen sent me a link to a nearby place, where you can do all kinds of fun things that involve jumping from high altitudes, called <a href="http://www.gojump.com">Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park</a>.</p> <p>Chris isn't able to go, but <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennyroe">Jenny</a> is going to go with me this Saturday.&nbsp; She doesn't want to ice skate, but we're hopefully going to be doing the 4 things that Zero Gravity offers.&nbsp; I've been wanting to bungee jump since my skydiving trip, but there's nowhere to do it locally.&nbsp; Zero Gravity offers that and so much more.</p> <h3><a href="http://www.gojump.com/bungee.html"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px" height="215" alt="animated_bungee_small" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/animated-bungee-small.gif" width="139" align="right"></a> <a href="http://www.gojump.com/bungee.html">Bungee Jumping</a></h3> <blockquote> <p><b>Bungee jumping</b> is done from an Air Boingo tower. It is not a crane, but a <b>seven-story permanent platform</b> especially for bungee jumping. We have a triple safety system:</p> <ul> <li>Super-elastic bungee cords - our bungee cords are so elastic they give you a ride that is much smoother than an ordinary rollercoaster ride.  <li>Nylon safety backup straps - the safety straps are strong enough that they would catch you even with no bungee cord attached  <li>A professional stuntman airbag underneath you - the air bag is rated for a fall even greater than the height of the tower </li></ul></blockquote> <p>Of course I'm going to do that, but in addition, they have something that looks even cooler!</p> <h3><a href="http://www.gojump.com/bungee.html"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px" height="236" alt="animated_net_big" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/animated-net-big.gif" width="139" align="right"></a> <a href="http://www.gojump.com/net.html">Nothin' But Net</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>Zero Gravity is proud to offer the ultimate thrill ride: <b>Nothin' But Net</b>. This ride is the the tallest in the park at <b>16 stories high</b>. We lift you to just below the top of the tower and then release you 100' into a net below. That's right - <b>no bungee, no parachute, just you and the air</b>. And the landing is smooth as silk.</p> <p>The patented release system insures that you land on your back â€“ even if you try to twist or turn. The landing is so smooth you will hardly notice it. When you land there are actually two Nets, one under the other, and each corner has a safety backup.</p> <p>The Nothin' But Net is the first ride of it's kind in the DFW area!</p></blockquote> <p>Additionally, these look fun: <a href="http://www.gojump.com/skycoaster.html">Skycoaster</a> and <a href="http://www.gojump.com/blastoff.html">Texas Blastoff</a>.</p>
