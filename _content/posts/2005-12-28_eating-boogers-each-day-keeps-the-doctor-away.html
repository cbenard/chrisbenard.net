<a href="http://www.2spare.com/item_39909.aspx" title="2Spare - The Top 10 Craziest Science Stuff you didn't know">The Top 10 Craziest Science Stuff you didn't know</a> has quite a few awesome facts.  For instance, regarding eating your boogers (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucophagy">mucophagy</a>):
<blockquote>Some research suggests that mucophagy may be a natural and even healthy activity, which exposes the digestive system to bacteria accumulated in the mucus, thereby helping to strengthen the immune system.</blockquote>
I've been saying the same thing for <strong>years</strong>. ;-)  Along with that awesome fact are "Men can breastfeed", "The Gay Bomb", "Erections After Death", "Hypnotizing Chickens", and a few others.  You should go and read them all.  Be sure to read the comments as well because I was literally <acronym title="Laughing Out Loud">LOL</acronym>ing after reading some of them, so don't miss out on that.
