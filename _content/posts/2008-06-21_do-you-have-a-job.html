<p>Those radio commercials are pretty ubiquitous.&#160; Every car dealership wants to know:</p>  <blockquote>Do you have a job??? Do you have $149??? Then you could be approved for a brand new Kia from Elkins Kia!</blockquote>  <p>What occurred to me the other day was that a person that doesn't have one or both of those might get upset at having the radio rub it in their face.&#160; That cracked me up in the car on the way home, and I thought I'd share it here.&#160; Imagine the following:</p>  <p>Radio: Do you have a job???   <br />Person: No...    <br />Radio: Do you have $149???    <br />Person: No... I just said I don't even have a job.    <br />Radio: Then you could be approved!...    <br />Person: Sigh.</p>  <p>I know that blog post was of little substance, but it still amused me, and as <a title="Chris Leon" href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish">Chris</a> and I always say, something is always better than nothing.</p>
