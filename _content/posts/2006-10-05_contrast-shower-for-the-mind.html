<a href="http://www.vsnaturopathy.com/Shower.html">Contrast showers</a> have long been regarded as a "way to stimulate vitality and promote detoxification".  Basically you get in the shower and you continually vary the temperature widely.  It's supposed to exercise your central nervous system or something by going from hot to cold several times.

I just had a contrast shower for the mind.  You won't understand that until you finish reading, so just bear with me while you read this.

<a href="http://robotbabytiger.blogspot.com">Chris</a> and <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=65220084">Natalie</a> came over to my house to watch TV.  Well actually it was because Natalie was in town from Baton Rouge and we wanted to go do something with her but Shreveport sucks.  We ended up watching the latest episodes of LOST, South Park, and Family Guy.

LOST was simply amazing.  That reminds me that I should give an obligatory shoutout to <a href="http://lost-and-gone-forever.blogspot.com/">the best LOST blog ever</a>.  The episode was without flaw and I'm glad it's finally back.  I was really starting to miss it, but the Dharma Initiative (see that blog) videos/viral marketing kept me going in the interim.

Then we watched the latest South Park.  It wasn't a real episode of South Park.  They showed the characters from South Park a few times, but it wasn't a real episode.  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5185665179342501914">See for yourself</a>.  The entire episode was a huge advertisement for World of Warcraft (purposefully not linking to it).  That is the worst game ever.  I played it for about 3 hours on Chris' trial account that he had.  He says I didn't play it correctly, but I will tell you that the most fun I had in that game was going to some carnival and typing /dance a lot.  WoW just sucks, as a game.  If you play that game, what the hell is wrong with you?

That was literally the worst television show I've ever seen.  I hope that Matt and Trey, the creators of South Park, got a lot of money to sell out like that.  That was the most incredible misuse of my hard drive space that could have been possible.  The funniest part of the entire episode was Cartman literally having explosive diarrhea expelled <strong>on his mother</strong>.  Yes, that was the funniest part, because the rest of the episode was about World of Warcraft and their loser online world.

So, could good come from that?  Yes, but not directly.  After that excuse of a show came on, we watched the latest episode of Family Guy.  Family guy is already one of, if not the, funniest shows on television.  I had already seen the episode 3 times before I watched it tonight, and I had laughed a lot each time, but not as thorougly as this time.  It was as if the South Park episode had cleansed my mental palate and made it ready for an incredible feast of intellectual enjoyment.  I must consider this the equivalent to a contrast shower for the mind.  I laughed tonight at Family Guy like I've never laughed before, if for no other reason than it was so funny in comparison to the "comedy" of South Park I had previously viewed.

In other news, <a href="http://www.fearlessthemovie.com/">Jet Li's Fearless</a> is an awesome movie.  I watched it twice, and I'd go again, but people just ruin movies.  I'm going to stop going to the theater unless I have a really good reason to do so in the future.  I'm not going to go just because it's Friday anymore.

I apologize for this post being slightly out of anger, but I couldn't bottle my rage about this abomination with which Matt and Trey have decided to start the South Park season.  I wish they were dead.  I can't even talk to Chris about it, because he's one of the WoW losers, and he thinks it was a good show.  He thinks I'm the stupid one for not liking it.  Every time I hear people talking about "XP" or "Manna" I want to go berzerk.

What in the world can people see in staying in a virtual world every waking moment of their life.  When you start the game, you have to go around killing what look to be anthropomorphic rats.  I guess <a href="http://krystal.dwightdesign.com/articles/whyILikeKrystal.html">some people</a> might find them attractive.  You have to do that and collect apples and gold and report back to someone who gives you new shoes.  I shit you not; people spend all day and night doing this stuff.  If you want to see an accurate depiction of the life of a WoW player, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5185665179342501914">watch that episode</a> of South Park.  If you want to see an episode of South Park, don't watch it.
