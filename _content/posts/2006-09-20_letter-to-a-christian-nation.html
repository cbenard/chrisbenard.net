I got home from school around 8:15pm and I had some school work to do.  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/httpwwwration-20/detail/0307265773/104-8461363-9024714">Letter to a Christian Nation</a> was sitting on my doorstep, so I said screw it.  I started reading it immediately and it's a very short book, so I finished it shortly before 10pm.

It's a great book, addressing all of the most common of Christian retorts when confronted with their complete lack of rationality for their beliefs.  It doesn't go deep into issues like <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/httpwwwration-20/detail/0393327655/104-8461363-9024714">The End of Faith</a> did, but then again, it's a tiny fraction of the size.  Excluding the preface, it's only 91 pages of text to read, and these are tiny pages.  It's a great reader and you can easily read it in under 2 hours.

It's really cheap and those links I gave give the <a href="http://www.rationalresponders.com">Rational Response Squad</a> a tiny fraction of your purchase if you buy it from those links.  I suggest everyone buy <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/httpwwwration-20/detail/0307265773/104-8461363-9024714">Letter to a Christian Nation</a>, because it's very accessible.  If you're really interested in much more in depth coverage of how religion hurts America and the rest of the world, grab <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/httpwwwration-20/detail/0393327655/104-8461363-9024714">The End of Faith</a>, too.  It's much longer, the pages are larger, and the issues are deeper.  It will take a little longer to read, but it's well worth it too.

Good job, <a href="http://www.samharris.org/">Sam Harris</a>.  I look forward to your next book.
