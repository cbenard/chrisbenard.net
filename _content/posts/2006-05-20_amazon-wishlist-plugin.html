I've added my <a href="/wishlist">Amazon Wishlist</a> to my blog.  It lets people see what I want and link to it to buy it from the Amazon site.  This was made possible because of a great plugin that <a href="http://www.lazyi.net">Ryan Prins</a> made.  After downloading it, I noticed a few issues that made the XHTML not validate and a <abbr title="The 'previous page' link would show if the number of items you have was less than or equal to the number that would fit on a single page.">small functionality issue</abbr>.

I fixed them on my side and created a <a href="/wp-content/plugins/amazon-wishlist/amazon-wishlist.patch.txt">simple patch</a> to fix the issues.  After I sent it to Ryan via an email, he quickly updated it and <a href="http://www.lazyi.net/archives/2006/05/20/amazon-wishlist-06-released/">thanked me on his site</a>.  I recommend you check out <a href="http://www.lazyi.net/projects/amazon-wishlist/">his plugin</a> if you use <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and the Amazon wishlist functionaity.
