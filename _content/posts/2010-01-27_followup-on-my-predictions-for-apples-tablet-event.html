<p>Happy birthday to me! Also, Apple announced their <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> today. One thing I meant to mention in my <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2010/01/26/my-predictions-for-apples-tablet-event-tomorrow/">previous predictions</a>: I thought it would have at least a front facing camera for video conferencing with iChat and/or Skype. I’m <strong>very</strong> surprised it doesn’t have that. I predict this will be in the first hardware revision of the device.</p>  <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>  <p>The iPad is basically a really big iPhone, but the iPhone is great. I was already prepared to buy a <a href="http://www.nook.com">Nook</a> for $259. The question is now do I pay $140 more to get an iPad that only has WiFi and no 3G data. The iPad is so much more than the Nook, but isn’t e-ink.</p>  <p>I haven’t decided yet. I was underwhelmed by what they’re offering, but impressed by the price at which it starts: $499. I would likely sling WiFi from my jailbroken iPhone to the device, rather than pay another $30 a month for unlimited 3G data and another $130 for the device with 3G built in.</p>  <p>Make recommendations to me in the comments!</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="iPad pricing data" border="0" alt="iPad pricing data" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/pricing.jpg" width="240" height="159" /> </p>  <h3 style="margin-top: 10px">Predictions Followup</h3>  <p>All photos are courtesy of <a href="http://live.gdgt.com/2010/01/27/live-apple-come-see-our-latest-creation-tablet-event-coverage/">GDGT’s live coverage</a>.</p>  <p>These were <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2010/01/26/my-predictions-for-apples-tablet-event-tomorrow/">my predictions</a> related to the tablet and the result. </p>  <ol>   <li>Apple will announce a tablet device of some kind.      <br />      <br />Result: They did.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Steve Jobs holding iPad" border="0" alt="Steve Jobs holding iPad" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mainpic.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>It’s name will begin with a lower case I. I have to get at least one correct, right? I’ll guess iTablet. I don’t think they’ll do iSlate.      <br />      <br />Result: iPad. Not a good name in my opinion. It opens itself to <a href="http://twitter.com/keithelder/statuses/8288997982">many jokes</a>.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Name is iPad" border="0" alt="Name is iPad" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ipadname.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>The device will not have an e-ink screen.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct.       <br /></li>    <li>The device will not have an AMOLED screen.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct.       <br /></li>    <li>It will be a conventional LCD screen with LED backlighting.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct (not sure about backlighting, but with 10 hours battery life, I would be surprised if it is not LED).       <br /></li>    <li>It will not run full OS X. Only a subset will be allowed, such as Safari, etc. Only apps from an app store will be allowed.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="iTunes in iPhone style interface" border="0" alt="iTunes in iPhone style interface" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/nofullosx.jpg" width="344" height="228" />       <br /></li>    <li>There will be a tablet app store.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct.       <br /></li>    <li>There will be backwards compatibility for iPhone apps running in some kind of emulation mode.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct. They can run in a pixel-perfect mode letterboxed or zoomed to full screen. All iPhone apps are compatible.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="iPhone app at 1x" border="0" alt="iPhone app at 1x" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/app1x.jpg" width="240" height="159" /> <img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="iPhone app at 2x" border="0" alt="iPhone app at 2x" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/app2x.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>There will be a innovative text input method. I can’t speculate as to what it will be, but knowing Apple, it will be good.      <br />      <br />Result: Wrong. Straight up QWERTY, just like the iPhone.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Standard QWERTY input" border="0" alt="Standard QWERTY input" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/keyboard.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>Its battery life will be expressed in hours, not days or weeks, unlike the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrisbenarddo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA">Kindle</a> or <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp">Nook</a>.       <br />      <br />Result: Correct. 10 hours.       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="10 hour battery life" border="0" alt="10 hour battery life" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/10hours.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>Verizon will be announced as a 3G data partner for the tablet device.      <br />      <br />Result: Wrong. AT&amp;T only. International carriers to be announced later. All devices are unlocked, and will work with any carrier compatible with micro SIMs (not Verizon or Sprint because they are CDMA [no SIM cards]).       <br />      <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="AT&amp;T data plan information" border="0" alt="AT&amp;T data plan information" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/att.jpg" width="240" height="159" />       <br /></li>    <li>The tablet will sell like hotcakes at first because Apple made it, but I think this will be a fad device and perhaps regarded as Apple’s second flop (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_%28platform%29">Newton</a>). I am putting this down “on paper” because I think it will be funny if I’m completely wrong and I can read my own words in a year or so.       <br />      <br />Result: Remains to be seen. I am underwhelmed, but my personal thoughts are at the top. </li> </ol>  <p>Here are the results of my other predictions for the event:</p>  <ol>   <li>No new iPhone will be announced.      <br />      <br />Result: Correct.       <br /></li>    <li>No AT&amp;T exclusivity related announcements will be made (this will be saved until <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/12/21/wwdc_2010_iphone_announcement_rumored_for_june_28_july_2.html">WWDC in June</a>).       <br />Result: Correct.       <br /></li>    <li>Incremental changes will be made for the iPhone OS, perhaps allowing some sort of rudimentary multitasking, perhaps in a 3.5 or 4.0 revision of the OS.      <br />      <br />Result: Wrong. No iPhone related announcements. </li> </ol>
