I believe they <strong><em>pride</em></strong> themselves on how long they can back the line up at the register. There were four employees there today, including the manager. I took the picture at the right today! I complained to him and asked him to open another register. He said it was shift change time and that they had to keep one register closed. The only problem with this is that <strong><em>it is always shift change time</em></strong>.</p>  <p><a href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish" rel="friend met">Chris Leon</a> and I go often for <a href="http://www.icee.com/">ICEE</a> time, and at different times of the work day, but we've always run into this, and we came up with The Law of Circle K Registers:</p>  <ol>   <li>Let <em>n</em> = number of Circle K employees on the clock </li>    <li>Let r = number of Circle K registers open </li>    <li>n &gt;= 2r + 1 </li> </ol>  <p>It's really annoying, and I wish there was a <a href="http://www.valero.com/">Valero</a> near my work.</p>
