<p>My house is finally listed and on the market (as MLS #: N114783)! It’s been repainted, the yard has been mowed, and Amanda and I worked really hard to get the house ready to sell by cleaning everything inside. I am using Robin Ramsey of the <a href="http://www.chrishayesteam.com">Chris Hayes Team</a> to sell the house, and so far I’m very satisfied with their work. This is a very important piece of my continuing quest to get out of Shreveport and move to Dallas.</p>  <p>You have to search to see the listing on the Chris Hayes Team site, so I’ve linked to the <a href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1611-Applewood_Shreveport_LA_71118_1111154800">data for the house</a> on realtor.com.
