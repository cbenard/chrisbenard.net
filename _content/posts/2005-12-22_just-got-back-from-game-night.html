I just got back from Jennifer's (<a href="http://lsus.facebook.com/profile.php?id=160000010">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/8204993">Myspace</a>) apartment.  She has game night on Wednesday for friends and other people.  I got a Christmas present!!! Jennifer gave me <a href="http://photos-n-01.facebook.com/n6/242/n160000010_30012242_865.jpg">these</a> <a href="http://photos-n-01.facebook.com/n6/234/n160000010_30012234_6697.jpg">pictures</a> in a frame.  Christmas came early this year!

We played Apples to Apples.  If you've not played this game, I think it is probably one of, if not the, best party games around.  It's really hard to explain and make it sound fun, but I assure you it is.  I'll write a detailed post about it later, but basically you match green cards, which are adjectives, to red cards, which are nouns.  You try to pick the best noun so the person will pick your word.  Object is to get the most green cards.  It's totally awesome and here's a <a href="http://imageserver4.textamerica.com/user.images.x/19/IMG_366019/_1214/TAS20051214205652262.jpg">picture of us playing Apples to Apples</a> last week.
