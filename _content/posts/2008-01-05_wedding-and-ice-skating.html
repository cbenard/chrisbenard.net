<p>Today, at 3 PM at the <a href="http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/DEPT/spar/parks/communitycenters.asp?facility_id=5">Randle T. Moore Center</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jdoey">Joey</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/natbrat1">Natalie</a> got married!&#160; I got to witness it all, and it's pretty weird to think about &quot;Natalie Wall&quot;, but I'm extremely happy for them both.&#160; I'm sure I'll add pictures to this post later when I have some.&#160; I didn't bring my camera, but there were plenty there.&#160; I wore fancy clothes that I never wear, so that's always fun, but those fancy shoes hurt my back a lot.</p>  <p>I helped mess up Joey's car and that was a lot of fun and then we didn't get to throw anything at them!&#160; They only had bubbles!&#160; I wanted to hit Joey with rice really hard!&#160; Oh well.&#160; I think they're going to <a href="http://www.rexburg.org/">Rexburg, Idaho</a> now for a gathering with Natalie's family or something.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.shreveporticerink.com/"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px" height="93" alt="Shreveport Ice Rink" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/logo.jpg" width="163" align="right" /></a> After the wedding, for which the reception ended around 7:15 PM, <a href="http://myspace.com/rumbl3fish">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/llembas">Jen</a>, and I went <a href="http://www.shreveporticerink.com/">ice skating downtown</a>.&#160; That was fun?&#160; I'm not sure, really.&#160; I think<a href="http://lsus.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=571624&amp;id=500741230&amp;ref=nf"><img style="margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px" height="249" alt="Ice Skating Fake Action Shot" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ice-thumb1.jpg" width="156" align="left" /></a> I had fun, but I also got cold and wet.&#160; Overall, I guess it was fun.&#160; Chris did really well, because he has rollerbladed a lot.&#160; Jen and I sucked hard at it.&#160; It's a lot easier when you go faster though.&#160; I fell a couple of times because I tried to go too fast and the first time I fell on my butt and my wallet pressed into my ass and my ass <strong>still</strong> hurts from it.&#160; Ouch.</p>  <p>The second time I fell was because a little kid was going the wrong way and we had an unavoidable (due to my lack of control over direction) collision and I fell on my knee that time and did a nice little twirl around my knee that looked like a trick one might do on purpose, if not for getting wet at the same time.&#160; That little kid tried to make me run into him again, but the second time as we were about to collide, I just picked him up.&#160; That cracks me up.&#160; So instead of us colliding, it was just me taking him in the direction I was going until he could get his footing again and then I put him back down and he almost fell again!&#160; He pretty much just fell from place to place on the ice.&#160; It was cute.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Jen <a href="http://llembas.livejournal.com/330198.html">blogged about our adventure</a> too.</p>  <p>I'd also like to point out that <a href="http://www.microseth.com/">Seth</a> blogged again, thanks in no small part to <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview">Windows Live Writer</a>.&#160; It's an amazing tool, and I'd really recommend it to everyone that blogs.</p>
