It came to my attention one year ago today, I started blogging.  I find that humorous, considering the anniversary of my post about how <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2005/12/20/i-hate-overstockcom/">I hate Overstock.com</a> has its anniversary three days from now.  The reason that's humorous is that I just got done ordering some Christmas gifts from there.

I suppose I can't just write to say that I started blogging a year ago.  It has been an interesting time, and while at times my updates were slow and far apart, I've kept at it.  I didn't know if I could enter that whole blogging thing, but I've certainly done better than <a href="http://robotbabytiger.blogspot.com">others</a>.

A year ago I worked at a <a href="http://www.highlandclinic.com">different place</a> that had a different website.  The current one is one of my design and programming.  I now work for a place where I don't dread going to work every day.  I never have to talk on a phone, and I get to program all day in a much more mature <a href="http://www.asp.net">programming language</a>.  I've gotten to work with a coworker and design a <a href="http://www.morrisdickson.com">new web site</a> for my current employer.

My semester is finally over, which means a year of school has gone by as well.  My GPA is back up to a 3.5 (I think), but I won't graduate for another year.  Hopefully, when I write a recap in a year, I'll be talking about my graduation in a day or two.  I have my grades for 3 of the 4 classes I was taking, and the ones I have are all As, and I'm hopeful the last one is as well.

Life is pretty good right now, and I'm in a much better position than I was a year ago.  I will endeavor to continue blogging when school and life allow me.
