I turned twenty-three years old on Friday (1/27/2006).  I also own at ping pong.

In other news, I now have <a href="http://myspace.com/cbenard">my own MySpace</a>.  You might have noticed it linked on the right hand side over there.  You didn't?  Have a look now.

Yes, my MySpace has a song playing in the background.  You know why?  There are three possible reasons:
<ol>
<li>You aren't logged in and you should so so.  If you don't have an account, create one.</li>
<li>You are logged in and you haven't turned off automatic music playing.  You suck.</li>
<li>You like music playing in the background of your pages.  What's wrong with you?</li></ol>

I decided to do so after being pressured by a few friends.  I said I'd never do it.  I said I'd never do it over and over and over.  I hated seeing the epileptic shock-inducing horror of <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=36767322">some</a> <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=28058375">people's</a> <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=33454600">pages</a>.

But I have <a href="http://www.myspace.com/meefawinc">several</a> <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rumbl3fish">rational</a> <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ln_rock">friends</a> who are on MySpace.  And, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/keithhightower">Mayor Keith Hightower</a> is on MySpace.  None of those profiles suck.  I figured if they can make non-sucky profiles and connect with friends, so can I.

... Plus I can't look at people's pictures unless I'm logged in.

I still like <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> way better, but MySpace does allow customization, which is both good for people like me, and bad for people like me who have to look at the previously mentioned horrible profiles.  MySpace also has the whole band thing going on that I'm getting into, and there are way more people on it.

Now I've just got to make my roommate <a href="http://courtneymalone.com">Courtney</a> make a profile.  He claims he'll die first.

I never thought I'd have a MySpace, but now I do.  Take a gander at <a href="http://myspace.com/cbenard">my MySpace profile</a>.  Happy birthday to me.

PS - <a href="http://www.michaelwiggins.net/blog/">Mike Wiggins</a> now has a blog.  Congratulations are now in order.
