<span class="postimageright" style="width: 185px;"><img src="/images/cokemachine.jpg" alt="Conveyor Belt Coke Machine" /></span>If you want the quick answer, skip to the last sentence.  Otherwise, read the dramatic tale of my first taste of Coke Zero below.<p style="clear: none;">Tonight, after my quiz in <abbr title="Chemistry 124: Inorganic Chemistry">CHEM124</abbr>, while waiting for the other students to turn in their quiz, I hurried downstairs to grab what I believed to be a delicious Diet Coke.</p><p style="clear: none;">Diet Coke and Coke Zero bottles look almost identical.  They had them both beside each other, and by the time I had selected B7 instead of B5, it was too late.  The stupid conveyor belt was rising to collect my coke (as pictured in the evil machine to the right).  I tried everything.  I pressed "CLR".  I pressed the return change button.  I hit the machine.  I cursed at the machine.  Nothing could undo what I had done.</p>
Stuck with the Coke Zero and crying a small bit inside, I returned dejected to my third floor class.  It took a while to muster the courage to try my first sip of Coke Zero.  I must say, I was not optimistic about it, because they say it "tastes more like regular Coke".  I <strong>HATE</strong> regular Coke; it's the worst drink ever.  I took my first sip.  Still having Bubble Tape in my mouth, which I've <a href="http://chrisbenard.net/2006/01/21/underworld-evolution-is-a-great-place-to-chew-gum/">previously mentioned</a> is the best gum ever, I couldn't get an accurate taste test.  I took out my gum and tried again.  At first I thought, "Not bad.  Not as good as Diet Coke, but not as bad as regular Coke".  I was wrong.  After my next few sips, I couldn't help hating myself a little for creating a cost rationale for my continued ingestion of this new substance.  I ended up not being able to finish it.  Coca-Cola, I want you to know, I now hate you.  I'm still addicted to Diet Coke, so you win this round, but seriously, <strong>stop making new products</strong>.  Just stop it.

I hate regular Coke.  Coke Zero tastes more like regular Coke.
