##Site

My last post was in [April 2012]({{ pcurl('2012/04/10/successful-unlock-of-two-att-iphones-iphone-3g-and-iphone-4s') }}),
so it's probably time for an update. I successfully imported my blog into a static HTML generating tool called [PieCrust](http://bolt80.com/piecrust/).
It creates the files serving this site now.

As part of the move, I totally redid the site's design and functionality at the same time. I had a lot of help (personal and technological). You can read more about it in the [about the site]({{ pcurl('aboutsite/') }}) section, linked at the bottom of every page.

##Host
I love the new host, which was recommended to me by [Juan](http://jtreminio.com). I'm hosted at <a rel="tooltip" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a2586db05512" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Referral link: If you spend $10, I get $10">Digital Ocean</a> now. I got a great deal by getting 2 months free by using code `SSDTWEET`. That code should work through June 2013, and if it's past then when you read this, just google another coupon code.

What you get with Digital Ocean is pretty amazing. You get to pick your Linux distribution, and they spin up the instance in under a minute.
I was able to provide an SSH public key and they spun it up with no root password, with the key, so I was able to login securely. Setting everything else
up has been a breeze, since I have full root access, and they even have console access (virtual KVM) in case I screw up the firewall rules.

I locked down the firewall, set up [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) (web server) with Google's [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) module and [php5-fpm](http://php-fpm.org/), which is needed for a few dynamic things like the [site search]({{ pcurl('search/') }}). I'll be posting more about that later.

I get all that for **$5/month**, and I emailed their support a question about DNS and got a quick reply back. So far, I'm very happy with their lowest
end instance.

##Old Site

This is what the old site looked like:
