I've known for a while that I was going to have to come in on the weekend.  It was supposed to be last week, but it got pushed back.  We had to deploy a new version of our practice management software, and the vendor doesn't have the ability to push it out as an msi.  We (two coworkers and I; the other coworker skipped out) had to go touch each machine., and that's a huge, tedious time killer.  No overtime, no comp time; I'm salaried.

I automated the large majority of it, so all we had to do was make sure it got to each machine.  I still don't like going to work for 4 hours on a Saturday.  I'm getting to be quite the VBScript master, automating a large amount of tasks via active directory.

I need to go finish season 2 of LOST, the best show ever.  I think that was my first personal blog post ever.  Wish me luck.  Working on the weekend sucks.
