<p>I can't believe it's over.&#160; I had my last final tonight and I ended up not even having to take it!&#160; My teacher decided to let us drop our lowest grade, and I had an A in the class already, so I didn't even take the final.&#160; That leaves me with 2 As and 2 Bs, on a semester when I didn't even try that much!&#160; Haha!</p>  <p>After the final, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sabrinad">Sabrina</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/aspencer1127">Ashley</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ktina555">Kristina</a>, <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=12781029">Bill</a>, and I all went to What's On Tap to celebrate!&#160; I don't even think it's quite hit me yet that it's actually over.&#160; It's hard to comprehend not going to school for my BS, since I've been doing it seemingly forever.&#160; I guess it'll pretty much be the same thing, now that I'm starting my MBA, but it feels really good to have accomplished my goal, after all these years, of getting a Bachelor of Science.&#160; The real celebration is the weekend after next.&#160; We're going to do it up big, I hope.</p>  <p>I smell like cigarettes, thanks to my friends Kristina and Sabrina (and Sabrina's friend Zach), but that's cool.&#160; It's better than dead carcass, and thankfully that smell has already died down a lot.</p>
