<p>Those words in the title now appear at the end of my <a href="http://business.latech.edu/graduate/mba.htm">MBA</a> transcript from <a href="http://www.latech.edu">Louisiana Tech University</a>. I will graduate Saturday, March 6th, 2010 with a Master of Business Administration and a concentration in <a href="http://www.business.latech.edu/graduate/iac.htm">Information Assurance</a>. There is nothing else left for me to do; school is over! If I hadn’t gotten the two B’s, I’d have a 4.000 average. Unfortunately, the school doesn’t do any cum laude stuff for graduate degrees.</p>  <pre style="font-size: 1.5em"> -----------------------Winter 2010-------------------------
