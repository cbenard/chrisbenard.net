<p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="127" alt="graduation" src="http://chrisbenard.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/graduation.jpg" width="164" align="right" border="0" /> I finally had my graduation ceremony Wednesday, December 19th.&#160; Some friends and family went with me to Buffalo Wild Wings afterward, and that was fun.&#160; I had a lot of leftover wings though, and against Bill's advice, I ate them Saturday for lunch.&#160; I think I might have gotten food poisoning.</p>  <p>Last night, I went out for a little while and then went to sleep around 3 AM.&#160; I felt fine at the time.&#160; However, I woke up at 5 AM shivering and convulsing.&#160; I got up, moved the thermostat from 73 to 76, put on more clothes, and got back under the covers, still incredibly cold for some reason.&#160; I went back to sleep.</p>  <p>I woke up a little while later burning up.&#160; I went back to sleep.</p>  <p>I then woke up again shivering and convulsing, cold for no reason, but I had to use the bathroom extremely badly (I'll spare the details).&#160; While traveling to the bathroom, I felt faint; I couldn't even focus on my own image in the mirror.&#160; While using the bathroom, I literally passed out on my shower doors to the left of me.&#160; I couldn't even stay conscious.&#160; I finally came to and went back to bed again, but I was still fainting on the way.&#160; I even passed out while laying flat.&#160; It felt like I was actually going to die.&#160; I couldn't even sit up without like passing out.&#160; I woke up finally at 10 AM feeling fine, except for a headache and being incredibly thirsty.</p>  <p>So, I have no idea what happened, or if it was food poisoning or what.&#160; I thought maybe it was a drug interaction with alcohol, since I take Singulair at night, but the Internets say that there is no such interaction.&#160; I just know I thought I might actually die, and that was kinda scary.</p>
