<p><span class="postimageright" style="width:160px"><a href="/images/noresize/2006chancellorslist.jpg"><img src="/images/2006chancellorslist_t.jpg" alt="2006 Chancellor's List Letter" /></a>2006 Chancellor's List Letter<br />(Click to enlarge)</span>I know I mentioned I got a 4.0 this semester and I was on the Chancellor's List again, but I actually got the letter from <a href="http://www.lsus.edu">LSU-S</a> today.  <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/co/">Vincent Marsala</a>, the Chancellor, was even kind enough to not actually sign them.  That's was pretty lame.  How hard could it be for him to sign the 4.0 student's letters?</p><p style="clear:none">I guess they thought they'd fool me with a cursive font.  That change of font on that part of the page really makes me feel special.  If you're not even going to use an <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/retro-gadget-tuesday-the-autopen-015872.php">Autopen</a>, why even bother.  At least that way I'd feel like you spent some money on me indirectly since you can't spare any of your time.</p>
