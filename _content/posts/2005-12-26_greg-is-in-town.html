We played <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/sets/1421773/">Xbox 360</a> for a while and then watched part of <a href="http://www.fox.com/tradingspouses/">Trading Spouses</a> from episodes that my roommate had downloaded.  It was the one with the crazy christian lady who's screaming <em>"SHE'S NOT A CHRIS-CHUN!!!"</em> and <em>"GARGOYLES!!!"</em> and <em>"DARK SIDED STUFF!!!"</em>.  Man, I just can't get enough of that episode.  It was really good to see Greg and Alan (only Greg) and not have parmesean cheese involved.  Thanks for coming by guys!

Greg is leaving tonight to go back to Houston, but I plan on going there for Easter to watch his play he's written about an android hobo living among us, collecting our change to finance his creator's hostile world takeover.  No, that's not a joke; it's just how creative Greg is.  Do <strong>NOT</strong> question him, <strong>EVER</strong>.
