Did the "Drag Pictures" get your attention?  Good.  ;) Those pictures are at the end of this post.  Read the rest of it before you get to those.

<a href="http://pirootofpi.com" title="Dave Anderson's Blog">Dave Anderson</a> has written a good writeup of a typical <a href="http://bestbuy.com" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> customer service experience.  He and I both worked in the computer area at Best Buy for quite a while.  I worked in "Services" for the duration of my employment, now <a href="http://geeksquad.com" rel="nofollow">Geek Squad</a>.  Dave worked in Computer Sales, and then Services.  Dave and I always gave good service, and I'm not trying to say the people in the store are not helpful, because a lot of them are (Katie, Ian, etc).

The problem lies in the fact that Best Buy, the corporation, seems to not have good communication within the corporate levels.  The people in the stores may be willing to help you, but they are having to fight the infrastructure to attempt it.  Dave and I both personally know about this.

Anyway, go read his posts on his blog (<a href="http://pirootofpi.com/dottext/archive/2005/12/22/159.aspx">first</a>, <a href="http://pirootofpi.com/dottext/archive/2005/12/22/162.aspx">second</a>).  He will update it as the story unfolds, but long story short, they sent off his laptop to get it fixed, and it came back to another cutomer's <strong>house</strong> and then made it next to impossible to get it back.  He still hasn't been able to get it back.  They also screwed up the PSP information which expired while they were working on it.

Also, if you really want to see something funny, check out <a title="Best Buy Store 363 Drag Pictures" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/sets/1005591/">these pictures</a> of managers and other people at our store dressed in <strong>drag</strong>.  I'd tell the story behind that, but it's more humorous if I don't.
