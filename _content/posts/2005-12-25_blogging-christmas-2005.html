<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/77476474/in/set-1659526/"><img src="/images/galileothermometer.jpg" alt="Galileo Thermometer" class="alignleft" /></a>Well, I had fun this Christmas.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/77476474/in/set-1659526/">I got</a> that neat <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/question663.htm">Galileo thermometer</a> that is over there on the left.  My mom said something like, "I wasn't sure how it worked, but it looked pretty nerdy, so I figured you'd like it".  I didn't get much else in the way of presents except cash, gift certificates, and food from relatives, but my parents did forgive quite a bit of debt that I owe them ($100 of the $450 I owe for 4 new tires I had to buy for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/45973589/">my Expedition</a>).

<p style="clear: none;">I bought my mom a hanging hammock chair, by <a href="http://www.hammaka.com" title="Warning: Flash-Heavy Site With Background Audio." onclick="return confirm('Warning:\nThe Hammaka.com site is a flash \'site\' and has background music playing.\n\nDo you still want to visit it?');">Hammaka</a>.  Here's a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/77476777/">picture of her sitting in it</a>.  She likes it a lot, and has already spent a great deal of time in it.  Today was a pretty nice day for sitting outside and we did.  I bought my dad <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385499345/qid=1135659834/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/002-4052275-9747268?n=507846&s=books&v=glance">The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization</a></em> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Thomas%20L.%20Friedman&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/002-4052275-9747268">Thomas L. Friedman</a>.  He's an awesome author and I read <em>The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</em>.  That was and awesome book, and I'm sure the one I bought <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cbenard/77472454/in/set-1659526/">my dad</a> will be just as good.</p>
