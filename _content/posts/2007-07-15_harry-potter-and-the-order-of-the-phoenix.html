I saw the new Harry Potter movie on Friday, and it was pretty disappointing.  Keep in mind that my comments come from the perspective of someone who has never picked up a Harry Potter book, but this movie was just boring.  I don't know if it is true to the book of the same name, but I can't imagine it is.

The entire movie was just about the mean lady (I've completely forgotten her name) and Harry teaching the other students defense against the dark arts, after he gives a speech about how he doesn't really know defense against the dark arts and that he just has luck.  I don't get it.

I really liked the first four.  I hope the next two are much better.  I think that's the shortest blog post I've ever written, but I don't want to give any spoilers away when I'd just be complaining anyway.
